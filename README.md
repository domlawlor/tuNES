# tuNES
Nes emulator in C++(mostly C).

Initial plan was to create the NES audio processing unit for a midi synthesizer, but then got sidetracked on emulating the whole console.

Current runs a games such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda, ect. More work on timing and mapper required to get other games working(eg. Battletoads, Punch Out, Mario Bros 3)
